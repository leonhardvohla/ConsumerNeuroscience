        During the Second ACR Workshop on Consumer Neuroscience, keynote
        speeches by Antoine Bechara (USC) and Piortr Winkielman (UCSD) as well
        as several “food-for-thought” talks offered a baseline for discussions.
        Workshop participants got together in groups to brain storm the
        relevance and validity of extant neurophysiological theories and
        framework (e.g., limbic system, dopaminergic reward system, somatic
        markers) for consumer neuroscience and vice versa.

        Conceptual, Methodological, and Substantive Opportunities for
        Collaboration at the Interface of Consumer Research and Functional
        Neuroimaging
      description: >-
        The First Workshop on Consumer Neuroscience was a Pre-Conference
        Workshop of the 2016 Association for Consumer Research Annual
        Conference. It was hosted at the Bauhaus Archive in Berlin, Germany on
        Thursday, October 27, 2016. During the pre-conference workshop, three
        “design thinking challenges” were offered and participants rotated
        between three tables and generated ideas. “Design thinking” is a method
        for solution-focused thinking and employs prototyping and social
        inspiration for creative problem resolution and was applied to
        conceptual, methodological, and substantive issues concerning consumer
        neuroscience. Two keynote speakers, Bernd Weber and Michael Schaefer,
        inspired participants with new ideas for collaboration.

      title: Neuromarketing and the Consumer
      description: >-
        During the 2018 ACR Workshop on Consumer Neuroscience, several scholarly
        talks provided “food-for-thought” on consumer research using fMRI, and
        Sarah Yu of Nielsen Consumer Neuroscience talked about how to apply
        neuroscience to market research.
